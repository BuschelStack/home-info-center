# Fix for "Heute" Display Issue

## Problem
The calendar was not displaying "Heute" (Today) for today's events, instead showing the actual date. This happened when calendar/call data didn't change for extended periods and network errors occurred.

## Root Cause
The backend version update logic for date changes was inside try-catch blocks. When network failures occurred (Google Calendar API, FritzBox, Weather API unavailable), the date change detection was bypassed, preventing version updates that would trigger frontend refreshes.

## Solution
Moved date change detection outside of try-catch blocks and ensured version updates occur in exception handlers when dates change. This guarantees that:

1. **Date changes are always detected** - regardless of network status
2. **Versions update on date changes** - even during API failures  
3. **Frontend gets notified** - through version polling mechanism
4. **UI refreshes properly** - "Heute" displays correctly

## Technical Details

### Before (Broken):
```python
def update_calendar_cache():
    while True:
        try:
            events = get_all_events()
            today_str = time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d', time.localtime())
            # Date check inside try block - fails during network errors
            if events != cache['events'] or last_version_date != today_str:
                cache['events_version'] = new_timestamp
        except Exception as e:
            # No version update - frontend won't refresh
            pass
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
def update_calendar_cache():
    while True:
        # Date check OUTSIDE try block - always executes
        today_str = time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d', time.localtime())
        date_changed = last_version_date != today_str
        
        try:
            events = get_all_events()
            if events != cache['events'] or date_changed:
                cache['events_version'] = new_timestamp
        except Exception as e:
            # Version updates even during errors if date changed
            if date_changed:
                cache['events_version'] = new_timestamp
```

## Files Modified
- `backend/app.py` - Updated all three cache update functions:
  - `update_calendar_cache()`
  - `update_calls_cache()`
  - `update_weather_cache()`

## Testing
The fix has been thoroughly tested with:
- Date change simulation tests
- Network error simulation tests  
- Frontend integration tests
- Complete build verification
